The Cask mission is to onboard web2 payment agreements into non-custodial alternatives in addition to providing web3 with sustainable business models. Cask is also building ways to automatically interact with various web3/defi protocols. The Cask wallet acts as a combined checking and savings account. Funds are transferred into a yield-bearing account and then those funds are usable in automatic money flows.",
